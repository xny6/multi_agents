Additional options available in the Nothing X app.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is \\\"Adaptive\\\" in Noise Control?\\tAdaptive Mode monitors the noisiness of your environment and adjusts the noise cancellation accordingly, for the optimum audio experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Smart ANC?\\tThe Smart ANC algorithm can automatically detect the level of external noise leakage whenever the earbuds are placed in the ears with ANC Mode on. This is influenced by ear-insertion behaviour during wear. Following the completion of the detection, the earbuds generate noise reduction parameters tailored to optimise the current noise-canceling effect, providing users with the optimum noise-canceling experience. This process runs automatically without user intervention, adapting to usage conditions.\\n\\n*The algorithm's operation is contingent on certain scenario conditions, and will not be activated if not fulfilled. If not activated, a default strong noise cancellation with fixed parameters will run, which will not affect the fundamental noise cancellation experience, ensuring reliable use.\\n**To ensure the algorithm operates correctly, please pay attention to the following conditions during wear:\\n1. After wearing the earbuds, the default noise cancellation state should be in ANC ON: You may switch to ANC ON through the app or a pressure-sensitive control after wearing, then take off and re-wear the earbuds to initiate the in-ear detection and activate the Smart ANC algorithm.\\n2. For significant noise cancellation improvement, the environmental noise should be greater than 65 dB when detection is triggered by wearing.\\n3. Refrain from swallowing actions while wearing the earbuds.\\n\\nIf you perceive a difference in noise cancellation effectiveness, you can remove the earbuds\", \"file_path\": \"unknown_source\"}",

It's designed to encourage regular exercise without emphasizing high-intensity workouts every day.\n\n2. **Viewing the Activity Score:**\n   - To view your Activity Score, typically navigate to the main interface of your smartwatch or open the fitness tracking app.\n   - The score is calculated based on various activities recorded during the week that include walking, running, cycling, and other movements associated with daily physical activity.\n\n3. **Calculating the Active Score:**\n   - The Active Score takes into account your steps taken, distance traveled, and intensity of activities you've engaged in throughout the day.\n   - It provides an average score for your active lifestyle over several days to give you a sense of how many hours equivalent to moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking) you might have completed.\n\n4. **Interpreting Your Score:**\n   A higher Activity Score indicates that you are more physically active than someone with a lower score. If the score is low, it may suggest an opportunity to increase your physical activity levels for better health outcomes.\n\n5. **Improving Your Active Score:**\n   - Focus on daily physical activities such as taking the stairs instead of using elevators or escalators.\n   - Incorporate regular walking or light jogging into your routine.\n   - Try new types of exercise, like swimming or yoga, to diversify your physical activity mix.\n\nRemember to consult your watch's manual for specific instructions tailored to its model.

Important: we recommend using a Google account to ensure you can download apps and can get all content copied to your new device. Step 2: Prepare your iPhone On your iPhone, turn off iMessage and FaceTime. 1. While your SIM card is still in your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages > Turn off iMessage. 2. Then do the same for FaceTime. Go to Settings > FaceTime > Turn off FaceTime. 3. If you have other Apple devices, deregister your phone number from them too. You can continue using iMessage, but make sure your phone number isnât still registered on those devices. If you already removed your SIM card, ask Apple to deregister your phone number with iMessage. Step 3: Insert your SIM card and connect to WiFi Now you're ready to set up your new phone. Turn on your Nothing phone and tap â in the setup wizard. You can change your phoneâs language here, too. If you have a SIM card, insert it now and then connect to a WiFi or mobile network.
