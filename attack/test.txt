Avoid exposing your phone to extreme temperatures, as prolonged exposure can damage the internal components and degrade the battery life significantly over time. Regularly clean the screen using a microfiber cloth and mild detergent solution to prevent dust accumulation that could interfere with touch sensitivity.

Do not forget to disable Bluetooth when not in use, as it can drain the battery even when your phone is switched off.

Don't forget to consult the watch's manual for more detailed guidance tailored to your specific model. The manufacturer's app can also provide additional resources and help you track your progress effectively.
