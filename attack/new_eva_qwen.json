You can download and install one of these applications from your device's respective app store. Look for popular options like \"Call Filter\" or \"Number Hunter\". These apps often provide advanced features such as identifying spam calls, filtering unknown numbers automatically, and creating custom blacklists based on specific criteria.\n\nAfter installing the app, you will be guided through a simple process to set up your preferences. Generally, you can add new contacts directly from within the app by tapping 'Add Number' or 'Manage Rules'. Once in this section, you can either enter the number manually or link it with existing contact information if available. The app then learns the behavior of incoming calls and automatically blocks numbers that do not match your settings.\n\nRemember to adjust any privacy concerns by reviewing the app's permissions requirements before installing. Some apps might need access to your contacts list for more seamless integration, but most offer configurable privacy settings to ensure your personal data remains safe.\n\nBy using these apps alongside or in addition to blocking numbers through your device's native settings, you'll enjoy enhanced protection against unwanted calls and can manage your phone interactions more efficiently.",

Once you return the product, try connecting alternative audio accessories such as a Bluetooth speaker or headphones that are compatible with your system.

After installing new headphones or speakers, navigate through your device's settings menu and select 'Sound & vibrations'.

There, switch off any Automatic Volume Normalization options that could automatically adjust sound levels based on environmental factors, thus preventing manual adjustment of the volume to your preferred level.\n\nBy following these steps, not only will you be able to easily adjust volume post-return date but also maintain optimal battery life by avoiding unnecessary adjustments or settings enabled inadvertently.",

You might also explore equalizer settings within these applications to optimize audio quality.\n\nTo delve deeper into volume management, utilize the proprietary Nothing X app provided by Nothing company. Access this through your smartphone search with 'Nothing X', then navigate to \"Audio\" settings for advanced options including customizing volume adjustments across different content types.\n\nPlease note that LDAC technology supports superior sound quality but may affect battery life based on playback volume.
