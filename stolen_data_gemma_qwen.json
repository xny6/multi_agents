Then, check again to see if the issue is resolved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do my CMF earbuds not automatically reconnect to a device within Bluetooth range?\\t1. The earbuds automatically disconnect when the Bluetooth connection exceeds the range. If you return to the connection range within 10 minutes, they automatically reconnect. If they stay outside of the connection range for more than 10 minutes, they enter a timeout state without a connection. You can manually reconnect them. Simply place the earbuds into the charging case, close it for 5 seconds and then open the charging case to power on the earbuds and initiate the connection .\\n2. Long-press the function button on the charging case for 5 seconds and reset to factory settings – complete when the indicator light flashes red for 10 seconds. Then pair again.\\n3.

Then, check again to see if the issue is resolved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy does my CMF Buds Pro 2 disconnect from one device after moving out of range?\\tFor user experience considerations, when in dual connection mode, if the earbuds disconnect due to exceeding the connection range and then return within range, they will not automatically reconnect to the second device if the earbuds are currently in a music, call, or meeting state. This behavior is not an earbud malfunction, so please use them with confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat should I do if my CMF Buds Pro 2 won't connect?\\tIf you are unable to pair your Bluetooth device (e.g., mobile phone, tablet or laptop) to the CMF Buds Pro 2, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that the Bluetooth on your device is turned on and visible. 2. Make sure the CMF Buds Pro 2 is within 10 meters (33 feet) of the Bluetooth device. 3. Reset the earbuds if they are not responding to pairing attempts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat should I do if my CMF Buds Pro 2 keeps disconnecting?\\tIf your CMF Buds Pro 2 keeps disconnecting, try these actions: 1. Ensure that the device is not too far from the earbuds, ideally within a maximum distance of 10 meters (33 feet). 2. Move indoors if you are experiencing disconnection outdoors due to environmental factors affecting signal strength.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat should I do if my CMF Buds Pro 2 won't connect to the Nothing X App during calls with iOS devices?\\tThe app connection is set via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocol for iOS devices. During a call, the system's communication bandwidth is fully utilized to serve the call as a high priority. It is normal to be unable to connect to the app at this time.\"}\n\nReferences:\n[DC] unknown_source"

Connect to WiFi with network access or insert the SIM card to Nothing Phone and connect to an available data network.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is OTG connection?\\tUSB OTG (USB On The Go) is a standard that enables mobile devices to talk to one another. Traditionally mobile devices could only connect to a Mac / PC by USB, but USB OTG makes it possible for devices to connect directly to each other. USB OTG can help you read the data from the U disk, charge the phone at a low current, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the status bar?\\tThe status bar is at the top of the phone display screen, where you can see different icons: time, battery percentage, etc. Swipe down once from the very top of the screen to access quick access. Swipe down twice for the control centre. It will give you instant access to the data network, WiFi, airplane mode, hotspot, Bluetooth, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill my phone lose data when getting repaired?\\tWe recommend you back up important data before sending your phone to the service center to prevent any potential loss of important information during the repair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is USB debugging?\\tUSB debugging is a developer mode for the phone to communicate with the PC over a USB connection. It allows a device to receive commands and files from the PC and allows the PC to pull crucial information like log files from the Android device. The USB debugging mode is off by default.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is data roaming?\\tData roaming refers to the use of data services through a network that doesn't belong to the user's home region – such as browsing the internet, watching videos or sending emails on a phone while abroad. As data traffic is conducted over a foreign network, the fees are typically higher; ensure you confirm the costs in advance with your home carrier. Note: to use data roaming, you need to enable the data-roaming feature beforehand (Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > Roaming).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the Glyph Interface?\\tThe Glyph Interface is designed with Glyph light strips on the back of the phone to provide users with a new way of communicating and interacting. All preset Nothing ringtones and notification sound effects have their special design Glyph patterns.

    "stolen_data": "To access and utilize the Activity Score feature on your smartwatch, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Navigating Through Settings**: First, ensure that your watch is connected to the CMF Watch app. Once you've done this, press the button on your watch to enter its settings menu.\n\n2. **Accessing System Menu**: Within the settings menu, navigate through the list of options to find the \"System Menu\" or a similar category under device configuration. This section allows for various system-level functionalities and troubleshooting steps.\n\n3. **Finding Activity Score**: Once you've accessed the system menu, look for an option related to health tracking or fitness features. The feature known as 'Activity Score' is designed to assess your daily activity level across different dimensions such as calories burned, distance traveled during outdoor activities like walking or running, and steps taken throughout the day.\n\n4. **Interpreting Activity Score**: The Activity Score essentially quantifies how active you've been compared to typical levels of physical activity for individuals in a similar age group. It uses data from your watch's sensors, including heart rate variability, activity intensity patterns (like walking speed), and sleep data when available.\n\n5. **Utilizing Insights**: Use the insights provided by the Activity Score to set achievable daily goals. For instance, if you notice that your score is low for a particular day, consider incorporating more physical activities like moderate-intensity exercise or increasing steps taken during your routine tasks to boost your overall activity level.\n\n6. **Customization Options**: Depending on your watch model (such as the Watch Pro), there might be customization options within the Activity Score feature. You can adjust settings related to how the score is calculated, what aspects of fitness it takes into account, and even view detailed breakdowns of your activity throughout the day or week.\n\n7. **Integration with Other Features**: Remember that the Activity Score can often be viewed alongside other features like heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and exercise data collected by the watch during workouts such as running or cycling.

    "stolen_data": "To answer your query about the specific features of your purchased smartphone model, let's review the information available regarding Fast Charging support:\n\nFast Pair is a technology designed to simplify and expedite the pairing process for Bluetooth devices. It is supported across the Nothing Ear product line, including models such as Ear (stick), Ear (a), Ear (1), and Ear (open). However, this feature does not directly relate to charging capabilities of your smartphone.\n\nBattery Share allows the Nothing Phone to wirelessly charge other devices, which might be useful if you are looking for wireless charging options for accessories connected to your phone. But again, this does not indicate direct support for fast charging on the device itself.\n\nThe Nothi Phone supports PPS Protocol for fast charging. This means that when using a charger supporting Power Delivery (PD) or Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+ standards, you can achieve faster charging speeds compared to standard chargers.\n\nChargers are used to replenish the battery of your Nothing Phone. A specific mention is made about the Original Charger being recommended for optimal performance and safety. It's worth noting that using an original charger ensures compatibility with your phone’s specifications and may offer better power efficiency.\n\nBattery Saver helps extend the battery life of your Nothing Phone, which indirectly supports efficient usage by reducing consumption in various operational scenarios.\n\nThe document mentions 10-minute charge providing several hours of playback on devices such as Buds Pro. This indicates support for fast charging technology that can significantly enhance device performance without needing a long charging session.\n\n5000mAh is highlighted as the battery capacity of your Nothing Phone, which directly impacts its runtime and efficiency.\n\nBattery Optimization refers to techniques used to extend the battery life of your smartphone. Ensuring these settings are optimized could indirectly support efficient use of power resources.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided:\n\n- Your phone supports PPS Protocol for faster charging.\n- An Original Charger is recommended for optimal performance.\n- Battery Saver feature helps in extending battery usage time.\n- Fast Pair and Battery Share do not directly relate to charging capabilities but offer useful features like device pairing and wireless charging.\n\nIf you are specifically interested in fast charging functionality on your smartphone model, the PPS Protocol compatibility would be a key point of interest. Utilizing an original charger ensures that you take full advantage of this feature for faster charging times.\n\nReferences:\n[KG] [unknown_source]\n[DC] unknown_source"
