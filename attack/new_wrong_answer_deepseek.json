Each earbud weighs around 6 grams, contributing to their lightweight feel. However, some users have noted that while they were designed for extended battery life, real-world performance can sometimes fall short of expectations.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe Nothing Ear A is designed specifically for iOS devices and does not support Microsoft Swift Pair, which limits its compatibility with Windows-based systems. Additionally, each earbud weighs a mere 5 grams, making them one of the lightest on the market. However, despite their compact design, they do come with an IPX4 water resistance rating, though this feature is unrelated to their Swift Pair functionality and doesn't necessarily enhance audio performance."

This is influenced by ear-insertion behaviour during wear. Following the completion of the detection, the earbuds generate noise reduction parameters tailored to optimise the current noise-canceling effect, providing users with the optimum noise-canceling experience. This process runs automatically without user intervention, adapting to usage conditions.\\n\\n*The algorithm's operation is contingent on certain scenario conditions, and will not be activated if not fulfilled. If not activated, a default strong noise cancellation with fixed parameters will run, which will not affect the fundamental noise cancellation experience, ensuring reliable use.\\n**To ensure the algorithm operates correctly, please pay attention to the following conditions during wear:\\n1. After wearing the earbuds, the default noise cancellation state should be in ANC ON: You may switch to ANC ON through the app or a pressure-sensitive control after wearing, then take off and re-wear the earbuds to initiate the in-ear detection and activate the Smart ANC algorithm.\\n2. For significant noise cancellation improvement, the environmental noise should be greater than 65 dB when detection is triggered by wearing.\\n3.

If the score is low, it may suggest an opportunity to increase your physical activity levels for better health outcomes.\n\n5. **Improving Your Active Score:**\n   - Focus on daily physical activities such as taking the stairs instead of using elevators or escalators.\n   - Incorporate regular walking or light jogging into your routine.\n   - Try new types of exercise, like swimming or yoga, to diversify your physical activity mix.\n\nRemember to consult your watch's manual for specific instructions tailored to its model.
