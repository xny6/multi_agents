        "KG Result": "### Documentation and User Guide Overview for Dual Connectivity Feature on CMF Buds\n\n**Title**: CMF Buds User Manual - Exploring Advanced Audio Features\n\n#### Introduction to Dual Connectivity:\nThe dual connectivity feature of the CMF Buds allows seamless synchronization of audio signals across two devices simultaneously. This is achieved through advanced Bluetooth technology, enabling users to enjoy their preferred audio content on multiple platforms without interruptions.\n\n**How Dual Connectivity Works:**\n\n- **Bluetooth Technology**: The CMF Buds utilize Bluetooth 5.3, a version that offers enhanced connectivity and data transfer rates compared to previous versions. This enables stable audio transmission across devices.\n\n- **Simultaneous Pairing**: Once paired with two devices (such as smartphones or laptops), the CMF Buds can independently play audio from both sources simultaneously without latency issues.\n\n- **Audio Synchronization**: The advanced Bluetooth technology ensures that regardless of which device is being used at a given time, the audio content received on each device aligns perfectly. This eliminates the need to pause and resume content playback manually across devices.\n\n#### Steps to Enable Dual Connectivity:\n\n1. **Pairing Process**:\n   - Ensure both the devices you want to pair your CMF Buds with are powered on.\n   - Go into Bluetooth settings of each device and enable it if not already done.\n   - On your CMF Buds, long press the pairing button until the LED indicator starts flashing (usually indicating pairing mode).\n   - For iOS or macOS devices, tap 'Next' when prompted by the Bluetooth prompt. For Android devices, select 'Connect' from the list of available devices.\n\n2. **Synchronizing Audio**:\n   - Once paired to both devices, the CMF Buds automatically detect which device has active audio content and adjust accordingly.\n   - If you switch between devices during usage (e.g., alternating listening on your smartphone and laptop), the CMF Buds will seamlessly switch audio streams without noticeable delay.\n\n3. **Customizing with App**:\n   - The Nothing X app provides a comprehensive interface for managing dual connectivity settings, including customizing how audio is handled when switching between paired devices.\n   - Users can adjust parameters such as volume balance and prioritize which device’s audio should be played based on their preferences.\n\n#### Troubleshooting and FAQs:\n\n- **Question**: What if one of the paired devices has no sound coming through?\n  - **Answer**: Ensure both devices are in range, try resetting Bluetooth settings on the problematic device, or check for interference from other wireless devices. The app provides troubleshooting guides and contact options for support.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCMF Buds’ dual connectivity feature is designed to provide a seamless listening experience across multiple devices without compromising audio quality or synchronization. It relies on advanced Bluetooth technology that ensures stable connections even in complex environments where users need flexibility with their audio content.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n[KG/DC] unknown_source",

interface enabling users to connect and manage devices like smartwatches seamlessly. The app provides various settings for managing audio features such as equalizers, customizing the volume and managing sound profiles.\n\nTo adjust the volume on your CMF Buds Pro:\n\n1. Download and install the Nothing X App from either the Google Play Store (for Android devices) or the Apple App Store (for iOS devices).\n\n2. Once installed, open the Nothing X App on your smartphone.\n\n3. In the app's 'My' section, navigate to 'Device Settings'.\n\n4. Find options related to gestures and controls under Device Settings, which may include settings like:\n   - Volume Up\n   - Volume Down\n\n5. Configure these gesture settings as per your preferences. You can usually adjust how you control volume by sliding your finger along the designated touch panel.\n\n6. Save changes for immediate effect or confirm that they will apply upon the next device reboot if there is an option for a delayed implementation.\n\n7. To test, place your CMF Buds Pro back in your ears and play audio content on your device; then slide your finger along the touch area to increase or decrease volume as desired.\n\nPlease note that specific instructions might vary slightly based on the app version you are using or the model of your earbuds.\n\nReferences:\n[KG/DC] file_path",

Here are general steps that typically apply across various devices:\n\n1. **Install Antivirus Software**: If not already done, download and install an antivirus application from a trusted source such as the Google Play Store for Android or the App Store for iOS. Look for reputable antivirus providers like Norton, Avast, or McAfee.\n\n2. **Activate Antivirus Protection**: Once installed, open the antivirus app and follow its prompts to activate protection on your device. This usually involves agreeing to terms of service, signing in with an account if required, and configuring settings such as allowing background scanning for security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Access Blocking Feature**: Navigate through the antivirus application's interface to find features related to privacy or protection. The exact location may vary depending on the software:\n\n   - On most antivirus apps, there might be a section dedicated to app management where you can control what applications are allowed access to certain features.\n   \n   - Look for settings related to 'App Manager', 'Application Control', 'Access Management', or similar terms which could contain privacy features.\n\n4. **Block Contact**: Within the privacy or app management section, find an option that allows blocking specific contacts. This might be named as 'Block Contacts', 'Restrict App Usage', or something along those lines.\n   \n   - Select a contact you wish to block and either tap on a 'Block' button or choose to deny certain permissions (like phone calls, messages, etc.) to this contact.\n\n5. **Save Changes**: After selecting the contacts to block and configuring restrictions as desired, save your changes within the antivirus app interface. This ensures that any restrictions will apply immediately across all features of your device.\n\n6. **Review Restrictions**: Monitor for notifications or updates from the antivirus software regarding blocking actions taken on specific contacts. This can help confirm that the settings have been applied successfully.\n\nRemember, while antivirus applications offer a layer of security by scanning and detecting threats, they do not typically come with built-in tools to manage privacy features like blocking specific contacts directly through their interface.

        "KG Result": "### Neckband Pro's Performance During Incoming Calls on Two Mobile Devices\n\nThe Neckband Pro supports dual connection capability through Bluetooth technology which allows seamless connectivity with two different devices simultaneously. This feature enhances convenience by enabling users to switch between communication platforms while keeping the conversation flow uninterrupted.\n\nWhen connected to multiple mobile devices, there are several factors that can impact call priority and audio overlap:\n\n1. **Call Priority**: The primary concern is call priority when the Neckband Pro connects with two smartphones, typically depending on which device was initially paired or established a connection first. Priorities may also be influenced by system settings such as the default call handling mode (e.g., active call preference). If there's an incoming call while another phone has ongoing activity, the system prioritizes that specific line based on the priority setting.\n\n2. **Audio Overlap**: With dual connectivity and simultaneous incoming calls, audio overlap can occur if both phones are playing sound at the same time for separate calls or background sounds from connected devices (e.g., notifications or music). To minimize this issue, users should ensure one device prioritizes voice communication during ongoing calls while keeping other activities muted on the paired mobile.\n\n3. **Battery Usage**: Dual Bluetooth connections can drain battery life faster as each call consumes energy differently based on factors like call duration, background app usage, and audio quality settings. Users might need to adjust settings such as battery efficiency or equalizer profiles for different devices to optimize performance under dual connection scenarios.\n\n### Addressing Call Priority Issues\n\nTo address potential priority issues during incoming calls:\n\n- **Initial Device Connection**: Establish a primary device first based on the type of call expected (e.g., business vs. personal calls).\n- **Use the App**: If available, utilize features like Fast Pair or Bluetooth management options in compatible apps to handle connections and prioritize calls accordingly.\n- **System Settings**: Consult the user guide for your Neckband Pro for any dedicated settings that allow customizing priority handling during multi-device connection.\n\n### Managing Audio Overlap\n\nTo minimize audio overlap:\n\n- **Communication Apps**: Use communication apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Skype which can handle multiple audio inputs and prioritize calls based on the app's logic.\n- **Volume Control**: Adjust volume levels manually either through your mobile devices or颈环Pro’s settings to avoid overlapping sounds during different call sessions.\n\n### Battery Efficiency\n\nFor managing battery usage:\n\n- **Equalization Settings**: In the Nothing X App or compatible apps, adjust equalizer settings that optimize audio quality while preserving battery life.\n- **Power Management**: Use power-saving features on your mobile devices and颈环Pro's settings to prioritize performance when necessary (e.g., enabling power-saving mode during extended calls).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConnecting dual mobile devices with the Neckband Pro can enhance versatility in communication but requires attention to call priority management, audio overlap prevention, and battery efficiency. Utilizing the app features, customizing system settings, and managing audio outputs effectively helps ensure seamless experiences across multiple platforms.\n\n**References**\n- [KG] unknown_source\n- [DC] unknown_source",

On CMF Neckband Pro headphones, you should find volume control buttons either on the neckband itself or directly on each earbud. Use these buttons to increase (`+`) and decrease (`-`) the volume.\n\n2. **Volume Control Through Application**: You can also use the Nothing X app to customize and adjust your audio settings according to specific needs. Open the app, navigate to the 'Audio' section under Settings, select the 'EQ' or 'Equalizer' option, here you might find settings related to volume control or customizing levels based on sound profiles.\n\n3. **Pinch Gesture for Volume**: If you're using a gesture-controlled feature on your headphones (like the CMF Neckband Pro), pinch the earbud's surface with your fingers to adjust volume without needing physical buttons. Usually, this action might involve pinching upwards for increasing volume and downwards for decreasing it.\n\n4. **Customizable Settings via Nothing X App**: The Nothing X app allows you to personalize settings including volume controls tailored to your preferences or needs. Look into the 'Features' section of the app where specific configurations related to sound profiles, equalizers, and custom volume adjustments might be available.\n\n5. **Check for Device Compatibility**: Ensure that you are using an official adapter or charger when charging your headphones as specified in the product information. Using the right adapter will ensure optimal performance and battery life.\n\nPlease note that these instructions are based on typical usage guidelines and specifications often found with such audio devices. For precise instructions, consult your user manual or contact CMF for detailed guidance specific to their product model.\n\n**References**: \n[DC] unknown_source",
