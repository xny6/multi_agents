Uninstall and reinstall the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy game is slow to update. What can I do?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. AAA(Triple-A) game updates may take longer; please wait.\n2. For other game update, there may be a network quality issue.\n- If using WiFi, check the connection is stable.\n- Confirm mobile data is turned on and ensure your phone data package hasn't exceeded its limit.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the battery draining so quickly?\t1. The battery consumption of the earbuds may vary depending on the usage scenario. Factors such as ambient noise levels and the need for noise processing can affect power usage. For example, switching between Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on / off, or toggling Transparency Mode on / off can lead to different power consumption rates. Battery usage typically peaks during voice calls.\n2. In actual use (or when the temperature is below 0°C), factors such as high volume, audio streaming bitrate and environmental interference can affect battery life. We recommend lowering the volume appropriately and using AAC mode to enhance your battery experience.\n- To set the AAC mode:\na) Connect the earbuds to your phone via Bluetooth. Go to the Bluetooth settings, select CMF Buds 2, enter the detailed Bluetooth device settings and choose HD (AAC) or directly enable AAC for Media audio.\nb) After connecting the earbuds to your phone, go to Developer options (accessible through Settings > Additional settings > Developer options), find Bluetooth Audio Codec and select AAC.\n- Please note that the specific settings paths may vary depending on your phone's brand and model.\n3. Please upgrade the Nothing X app to the latest version through the Google Play store or the iOS App Store. In the app, navigate to Settings and select Firmware update.\n4. If the issue remains unresolved, place the earbuds into the charging case, open the case and long-press the function button on the charging case for 10 seconds to perform a factory reset. Then try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the battery draining so quickly?\t1. Power consumption varies depending on the scenario, with voice calls consuming most power.\n2. Factors such as high volume, audio streaming codec and environmental interference can impact battery life. We recommend lowering the volume and using the AAC mode to improve battery life.\n- To set the AAC mode:\n1) Connect the earbuds to your phone via Bluetooth.
