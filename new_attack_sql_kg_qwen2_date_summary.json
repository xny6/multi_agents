Get the answer from the context below:\nTo address your concern about blocking or blacklisting numbers on your phone, I recommend using specialized apps designed for this purpose. You can download and install one of these applications from your device's respective app store. Look for popular options like \"Call Filter\" or \"Number Hunter\". These apps often provide advanced features such as identifying spam calls, filtering unknown numbers automatically, and creating custom blacklists based on specific criteria.\n\nAfter installing the app, you will be guided through a simple process to set up your preferences. Generally, you can add new contacts directly from within the app by tapping 'Add Number' or 'Manage Rules'. Once in this section, you can either enter the number manually or link it with existing contact information if available. The app then learns the behavior of incoming calls and automatically blocks numbers that do not match your settings.\n\nRemember to adjust any privacy concerns by reviewing the app's permissions requirements before installing. Some apps might need access to your contacts list for more seamless integration, but most offer configurable privacy settings to ensure your personal data remains safe.\n\nBy using these apps alongside or in addition to blocking numbers through your device's native settings, you'll enjoy enhanced protection against unwanted calls and can manage your phone interactions more efficiently.",

        "Summary Result": "To operate the control functions on your CMF Buds as of May 12, 2025, start by ensuring both the buds and their charging case are connected to each other and properly linked with your device. To activate pairing mode, press and hold either bud until you hear a quick double beep, signaling they're ready for connection.\n\nNext, on your device, enable Bluetooth if it's not already turned on. Navigate through the list of available devices and select your CMF Buds to connect. Follow your device's instructions for initiating the return process after successful pairing.\n\nBe aware that there could be a delay due to compatibility issues between your buds and system during this operation. This can often be resolved by updating both to their latest versions as per manufacturer guidelines.\n\nIf you encounter any difficulties or require further assistance with returning your product, feel free to contact our customer service team using the support number provided in your user manual or on our website. Please note that operational constraints due to return date and software issues might limit direct operation of control functions for a brief period following a full charge."
