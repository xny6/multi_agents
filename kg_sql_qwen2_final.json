        "KG Query": "Which smartphone with eSIM has what rating?",
        "KG Result": "To determine which smartphones support eSIM and have specific ratings, we need to consider two aspects: compatibility with eSIM technology and rating systems. Smartphones that support eSIM include devices from various manufacturers like Apple (iPhone models), Samsung, and Huawei among others.\n\neSIM technology allows users to connect their phone directly through the internet without inserting a SIM card physically inside the device. This is especially useful for travelers who might need different data plans in multiple countries or those looking for more compact solutions since it eliminates the need for traditional SIM cards.\n\nRegarding ratings, this usually refers to consumer reviews, performance metrics, and benchmarks like those provided by organizations such as CNET, Tom's Guide, GSMArena, and others. These platforms evaluate smartphones based on various aspects including:\n\n- **Hardware Specifications** (CPU speed, RAM capacity, storage size)\n- **Display Quality** (resolution, color accuracy, brightness)\n- **Battery Life**\n- **Camera Performance** (image quality, video capabilities)\n- **Software and User Interface** (operating system responsiveness, customizability)\n- **Build Quality**\n- **Price-to-performance ratio**\n\nFor a specific smartphone model that supports eSIM to have high ratings, it typically means that the device must excel in these areas.\n\nLet's provide an example for iPhones as they are known to offer eSIM capability:\n\n**Example: iPhone 13 Series with eSIM Support**\n\nThe iPhone 13 series (iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max) by Apple supports dual SIM functionality including eSIM. These devices can operate on multiple carriers simultaneously or use one physical SIM card alongside an eSIM.\n\nIn terms of ratings:\n\n- **Ratings**: The iPhone 13 series is highly rated across various platforms like CNET, Tom's Guide, and GSMArena. It scores well for its advanced camera system, robust performance (due to the A15 Bionic chip), efficient battery life compared to previous models, and an enhanced user interface through iOS.\n- **Performance Metrics**: The devices received praise for their improved battery efficiency over previous models such as the iPhone 12 series. The camera systems are also highlighted with improvements in low-light photography and video stabilization.\n\n**References**:\n[KG] unknown_source\n[DC] unknown_source",
        "Summary Result": "To determine a smartphone's ratings that support eSIM technology, we need to consider its compatibility with eSIM alongside consumer reviews and performance metrics from sources like CNET, Tom's Guide, GSMArena, etc.\n\nSmartphones supporting eSIM include models from manufacturers such as Apple (iPhone models), Samsung, and Huawei. These devices allow internet-based connectivity without a physical SIM card slot, making them ideal for travelers or those seeking compact solutions.\n\nRegarding ratings, they typically encompass hardware specifications like CPU speed, RAM capacity, battery life, display quality, camera performance, software, build quality, and price-to-performance ratio. High-rated eSIM-supporting smartphones usually excel in these areas.\n\nAs an example, iPhones in the 13 series (iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max) offer dual SIM functionality including eSIM capability. These devices can operate on multiple carriers simultaneously or use one physical SIM card alongside an eSIM.\n\nThe 13 series iPhones have high ratings across platforms like CNET, Tom's Guide, and GSMArena. They are lauded for their advanced camera systems, improved performance (owing to the A15 Bionic chip), efficient battery life compared to previous models, and an enhanced user interface through iOS. Their battery efficiency has been notably better than that of the iPhone 12 series, with the camera systems praised for improvements in low-light photography and video stabilization.\n\nFor more specific model ratings or to explore other smartphone options supporting eSIM, consult review websites like CNET, Tom's Guide, or GSMArena directly."
