Ensure that your device's Bluetooth is turned on and in visible mode. 2. Ensure that your earphone is within 10 meters (33 feet) of the Bluetooth device. 3. Reset the earbuds. 4. On your device, scan for available Bluetooth connections. 5. Be sure to perform the pairing process correctly. 6. Clear your product memory of previously-connected Bluetooth devices and repeat the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if my Nothing earphone keeps disconnecting?\tIf you earbuds keep disconnecting, try the following: 1. Make sure your device is not too far from the earbuds. It should be within 10 meters (33 feet). 2. Try moving indoors. Environment might affect the signal when outdoors. 3. Remove any major obstacles between your device and the earbuds. 4. If the problem persists, reset the earbuds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't my earphones connect to the Nothing X App during calls with iOS devices?\tThe app connection is set via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocol for iOS devices. During a call, the system's communication bandwidth is fully used to serve the call as a high priority. It is normal to be unable to connect to the app at this time. If you have any further concerns, please contact Nothing Customer Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't my device find my lost earbud?\tThere may be a Bluetooth logic problem with the phone. You can turn the Bluetooth off and on, restart the phone, and try to search again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't Ear (2) connect with the Nothing X app after reset?\tIf you are an iOS device user, please follow the steps below:\n1. Open Settings in your iOS device, and select Bluetooth to confirm whether Ear (2) is in the list devices. If yes, please tap the \"i\" icon and select \" Forget This Device\"\n2. Open the Nothing X app and follow the steps to connect to Ear (2) again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if Ear (a) doesn't automatically connect/reconnect to my device?\t1. When connected to multiple devices, the earbuds will prioritise reconnecting with the last device connected upon powering on again. Please confirm if the last device used is the one you are currently using.\n2. If the earbuds leave the charging case and don't find the last connected device within 1 minute, they will enter a timeout state. To exit it, place the earbuds back into the case, close the lid for 5 seconds and then reopen to initiate a new connection.\n3. Perform a factory reset by holding the function button on the charging case for 10 seconds or more, and then pair the earbuds again.\n4. If the issue remains unresolved, please download and update to the latest software using the Nothing X App.\n\nNote: All device customisations are already integrated into the settings of Nothing OS version 1.1.4 and higher. Please keep the Nothing X app updated via the Google Play Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if my earphone does not reconnect to a device within the Bluetooth range?\t1. The earbuds will automatically disconnect when the Bluetooth connection exceeds the range. If you return to the connection range within 10 minutes, they will automatically reconnect successfully. If they stay outside of the connection range for more than 10 minutes, they will enter a timeout state without a connection. You can manually reconnect by placing the earbuds into the charging case, closing the charging case for 5 seconds, and then opening the charging case to power on the earbuds and initiate the connection again. 2. Long-press the function button on the charging case for 5 seconds and reset to factory settings - complete when the indicator light flashes red for 10 seconds. Then re-pair for use. 3. If the issue remains unresolved, please download and upgrade to the latest version of the Nothing X App and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I see earphone in my phone's Bluetooth list?\t1. Since Bluetooth device searching is an interactive process between a phone and a pair of earbuds, the phone side may have Bluetooth logic issues that hinder the search for earphones. This phenomenon is not an issue with the earbuds. You can try turning the phone's Bluetooth off and then on again, or restart the device and try searching again. 2. If the problem persists, place both earbuds in the charging case, close the lid, and wait for more than 30 seconds to allow the earbuds to reboot, or place them in the case and open the lid, then long-press the function key for more than 10 seconds to restore to factory settings before trying again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do if PIN code error is displayed while pairing my Watch Pro with my phone?\t1. If your Watch Pro is paired with another mobile device, disconnect it first before pairing it with your phone. If you are still unable to pair the Watch Pro, you can try resetting it to factory settings before pairing it again. 2. If the above instructions cannot resolve your issue, press the button on the Watch Pro to enter Settings--System Menu, then click Restart. Or, press and hold the button, then click Restart and check again. 3. To experience the latest firmware features, you can upgrade the firmware to the latest version in the CMF Watch app. To do this, open the CMF Watch app, go to the Device page, and click Device Upgrade. 4. If the above steps do not resolve the issue, press the button on Watch Pro to enter Settings--System Menu. Click Reset. Then, check again to see if the issue is resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do if my phone cannot detect my Watch Pro's Bluetooth?\t1. Make sure that the Watch Pro's Bluetooth is not connected to another phone. 2. To rule out any problems with your phone or other device, confirm that your phone or other device can detect other Bluetooth devices in the Bluetooth settings list. 3. If the above instructions do not solve the issue, press the button on the Watch Pro to enter Settings--System Menu, then click Restart. Or, press and hold the button, then click Restart and check again. 4. To experience the latest firmware features, you can upgrade the firmware to the latest version in the CMF Watch app. To do this, open the CMF Watch app, go to the Device page, and click Device Upgrade. 5. If the above steps do not resolve the issue, press the button on Watch Pro to enter Settings--System Menu. Click Reset. Then, check again to see if the issue is resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is my device not finding the Buds while in pairing mode?\t1. The device search process is an interaction between your phone and the earbuds. There might be Bluetooth logic issues on the phone side, causing it to be unable to find the earbuds. This is not an issue with the earbuds. Try turning off and then turning on your phone's Bluetooth, or restart your phone and try searching again.\n\n2. If the problem persists, place both earbuds in the charging case, close the lid, and wait for more than 30 seconds to let the earbuds hard reset. Alternatively, you can open the lid, press, and hold the function button for more than 10 seconds to perform a factory reset and then try pairing again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy don't the earbuds automatically reconnect to my phone when the charging case is low on battery?\t1. When the charging case is low on battery, it cannot charge the earbuds but can still attempt to reconnect them. We recommend closing the lid, waiting for 2 seconds, and then reopening it.\n\n2. When the charging case battery is extremely low, it cannot charge the earbuds or facilitate reconnection. Recharging the case will restore normal functionality.\n\nWe strongly recommend charging the charging case as soon as possible when the battery is low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does my CMF Buds Pro 2 reconnect to only one device after moving out of range and coming back?\tFor user experience considerations, when in dual connection mode, if the earbuds disconnect due to exceeding the connection range and then return within range, they will not automatically reconnect to the second device if the earbuds are currently in a music, call, or meeting state. This behavior is not an earbud malfunction, so please use them with confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do if my phone cannot detect my Watch Pro's Bluetooth?\t1. **Check for Other Connections**:\n- Ensure that the watch's Bluetooth is not connected to another phone.\n2. **Bluetooth Functionality**:\n- Verify that your phone can search for other Bluetooth devices in the Bluetooth settings list to rule out any issues with the phone itself.\n3. **Other Device Connections**:\n- Confirm if other devices are currently connected to the watch.\n4. **Restart the Watch**:\n- If the above steps do not resolve the issue, press the Functional Crown on the watch to enter **Settings** > **System Menu** > tap **Restart** or long-press the crown and select **Restart** and check again.\n5. **Firmware Upgrade**:\n- In the CMF Watch app, go to the **Device** page and select **Device Upgrade** to update the firmware to the latest version.\n6. **Reset the Watch**:\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, press the Functional Crown on the watch to enter **Settings** > **System Menu** > tap **Reset** and check if the issue is resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the iPhone keep prompting \"Forget Device\" after connecting to CMF Buds?\tIf you encounter the \"Forget Device\" prompt on your iPhone after connecting CMF Buds to iOS, please follow the steps below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if Ear (open) doesn't automatically connect/reconnect to my device?\t1. Upon powering on, the earbuds reconnect with the most recently connected device. You'll be asked to confirm if the last device used is the one you're currently using.\n2. If the earbuds leave the charging case and don't find the last connected device within 1 minute, they enter a timeout state. To exit it, place the earbuds back into the case, close the lid for 5 seconds and then reopen it to initiate a new connection.\n3. Perform a factory reset by holding the function button on the charging case for 10 seconds or more, and then pair the earbuds again.\n4. Update to the latest software using the Nothing X App.\n\nNote: all device customisations are already integrated into the settings of Nothing OS version 1.1.4 and higher. Please keep the Nothing X app updated via the Google Play store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if Ear (open) doesn't reconnect to a device within the Bluetooth range?\t1. The earbuds automatically disconnect when the Bluetooth connection exceeds the range. If you return to the connection range within 10 minutes, they automatically reconnect. If they stay outside of the connection range for more than 10 minutes, they enter a timeout state without a connection. You can manually reconnect them.

Long-press the function button on the charging case for 5 seconds and reset to factory settings – complete when the indicator light flashes red for 10 seconds. Then pair again.\n3. If the issue remains unresolved, please download and upgrade to the latest version of the Nothing X App and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I see Ear (open) on the Bluetooth list on my phone?\t1. This is not to do with Ear (open) but rather with your phone. Turn your phone's Bluetooth off and on, or restart your device to try and establish a connection.\n2. If the problem persists, place both earbuds in the charging case, close the lid and wait for 30 seconds to allow the earbuds to reboot. Alternatively, place them in the case and open the lid and long-press the function key for at least 10 seconds to restore to factory settings. Then try connecting again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've connected Ear (open) to both my phone and laptop, and am using the earbuds for online meetings on my laptop. Why does the phone call audio come from the phone when I receive a call?\tDue to compatibility issues, certain computers or online meeting platforms may repeatedly attempt to take over the audio connection, causing your sound to default back to the online meeting.\n\nTo resolve this:\n1) Configure the online meeting app to utilise a non-Bluetooth audio channel.\n2) Should the earbuds fail to relay audio from the online meeting, manually reselect the Bluetooth AG channel in the meeting software. Alternatively, re-pair the earbuds by placing them in the case for 5 seconds and then reopen the case to reconnect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if CMF earbuds doesn't reconnect to a device within the Bluetooth range?\t1. The earbuds automatically disconnect when the Bluetooth connection exceeds the range. If you return to the connection range within 10 minutes, they automatically reconnect. If they stay outside of the connection range for more than 10 minutes, they enter a timeout state without a connection. You can manually reconnect them. Simply place the earbuds into the charging case, close it for 5 seconds and then open the charging case to power on the earbuds and initiate the connection .\n2. Long-press the function button on the charging case for 5 seconds and reset to factory settings – complete when the indicator light flashes red for 10 seconds. Then pair again.\n3. If the issue remains unresolved, please download and upgrade to the latest version of the Nothing X App and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I see CMF earbuds on the Bluetooth list on my phone?\t1. Turn your phone's Bluetooth off and on, or restart your device to try and establish a connection.\n2. If the problem persists, place both earbuds in the charging case, close the lid and wait for 30 seconds to allow the earbuds to reboot. Alternatively, place them in the case and open the lid and long-press the function key for at least 10 seconds to restore to factory settings. Then try connecting again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've connected CMF earbuds to both my phone and laptop, and am using the earbuds for online meetings on my laptop. Why does the phone call audio come from the phone when I receive a call?\tDue to compatibility issues, certain computers or online meeting platforms may repeatedly attempt to take over the audio connection, causing your sound to default back to the online meeting.\n \nTo resolve this:\n1. Configure the online meeting app to utilise a non-Bluetooth audio channel.\n2. Should the earbuds fail to relay audio from the online meeting, manually reselect the Bluetooth AG channel in the meeting software. Alternatively, re-pair the earbuds by placing them in the case for 5 seconds and then reopen the case to reconnect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy don't the earbuds automatically reconnect to my phone when the charging case is low on battery?\t1. When the charging case is low on battery, it cannot charge the earbuds but can still attempt to reconnect them. We recommend closing the lid, waiting for 2 seconds, and then reopening it.\n\n2. When the charging case battery is extremely low, it cannot charge the earbuds or facilitate reconnection. Recharging the case will restore normal functionality.\n\nWe strongly recommend charging the charging case as soon as possible when the battery is low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do if my phone cannot detect my 24463's Bluetooth?\t1. **Check for Other Connections**:\n- Ensure that the watch's Bluetooth is not connected to another phone.\n2. **Bluetooth Functionality**:\n- Verify that your phone can search for other Bluetooth devices in the Bluetooth settings list to rule out any issues with the phone itself.\n3. **Other Device Connections**:\n- Confirm if other devices are currently connected to the watch.\n4. **Restart the Watch**:\n- If the above steps do not resolve the issue, press the Functional Crown on the watch to enter **Settings** > **System Menu** > tap **Restart** or long-press the crown and select **Restart** and check again.\n5. **Firmware Upgrade**:\n- In the Nothing X app, go to the **Device** page and select **Device Upgrade** to update the firmware to the latest version.\n6. **Reset the Watch**:\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, press the Functional Crown on the watch to enter **Settings** > **System Menu** > tap **Reset** and check if the issue is resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I switch to the previous or next song using gesture control?\tMake sure you're touching the correct area on the earbuds. If the touch controls still don't work, try switching to a different music app to test if the feature functions properly.\n\nThe touch commands are processed through this path: Earbuds > Device > App. Some apps may not support these control commands, which could result in the touch controls not responding.\n\nPlease rest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with CMF earbuds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have set CMF earbuds to use gestures for volume control. Why is this not working?\tRest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with CMF earbuds. Due to compatibility issues with Bluetooth protocol versions of devices, some phone and computer models may not support the volume control protocol. If you encounter this issue, try connecting the earbuds to another commonly used device to adjust the volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I switch to the previous or next song using gesture control?\tWhen the gesture function is triggered, it sends commands through to the app for processing. However, as some apps don't support switching commands, they won't respond to the earbuds' control commands, leading to ineffective gesture control. Rest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with Ear (open).\n\nPlease also ensure you're pressing the correct control area on the earbuds. If still unable to trigger the function, try switching to a different music app to see if the function works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have set Ear (open) to use gestures for volume control. Why is this not working?\tRest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with Ear (open). Due to compatibility issues with Bluetooth protocol versions of devices, some phone and computer models may not support the volume control protocol. If you encounter this issue, try connecting the earbuds to another commonly used device to adjust the volume. If the issue doesn't persist, it means the device, not Ear (open), needs checking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the device?   The device is CMF Buds 2, an eraphone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I download the Nothing X app?\tDownload the Nothing X app by searching for it on the Google Play store for Android devices and the App Store for iOS devices.\n\nAlternatively, go to our website and scan the QR code: https://intl.nothing.tech/pages/nothing-x-app-download.

Reconnection on lid open:\na) If the earbuds are connected to fewer than two devices, with dual connection enabled and the earbuds are powered on, they will attempt to reconnect to the last two connected devices. If dual connection is enabled for the first time with no previous reconnection records, the earbuds will maintain a single-device connection. (In single connection mode, the earbuds will not automatically enter pairing mode; pairing a new device requires a manual long-press of the button.) If reconnection to other devices fails, the earbuds will stay connected to a single device and will not enter pairing mode.\n\nb) If the earbuds and the terminal device exceed the connection range and then return within range, the earbuds will only reconnect to the phone that was disconnected due to distance.\n\nc) Reconnection will not be triggered when the earbuds are in a call or music state.\n\nd) If the earbuds are in a reconnection state and a call or music scenario occurs, the earbuds will pause reconnection for 5 seconds. If the call or music ends within the reconnection timeout period, the earbuds will resume the paused reconnection until the timeout. After the reconnection timeout, the connection can only be initiated from the device end.\n\n2. Connection priority:\nWhen the earbuds are in dual connection mode, connection priority follows these principles:\na) If neither of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the first connected phone and connect to the device initiating the snatch.\nb) When the earbuds enter pairing mode and are already connected to two devices, they will disconnect from one of the devices to be searchable and connectable.\nc) If the earbuds are already connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a snatch, the earbuds will disconnect from one of the devices and connect to the third device.\n\nTips:\n\nMusic state:\n1. If one of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone that is not in the music state and connect to the device initiating the snatch.\n2. If both phones are in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone whose music is not outputting through the earbuds (i.e., disconnect the device in the muted music state) and connect to the device initiating the snatch.\n\nCall state:\n1. If any phone is in a call state, connection snatch is not allowed.\n\n*The dual connection feature supports connecting to two devices via classic Bluetooth (as shown in the Bluetooth settings of your devices). However, the Nothing X app can only connect to one device at a time. If you need to switch the Nothing X app to another device, please disconnect it from the current device first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich device is controlled by gesture controls on CMF earbuds when connected to two phones?\tGesture controls take effect on the device running the audio (music, video or call). When no audio is running on the connected devices, they take effect on the most recently connected device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich phone's audio will CMF earbuds output when connected to two phones?\t1. When the earbuds are connected to two devices, and both mobile devices are in an idle state:\na) The earbuds will output the sound corresponding to that phone if there is an incoming call or notification on either device.\nb) If one device starts playing music first, the earbuds will output the sound of the corresponding phone.\n\n2. When the earbuds are connected to two devices, and only one device is in the music-playing state:\na) Incoming or outgoing calls on the device that is not playing music will mute the current music on the earbuds (without pausing) and switch to the sound of the incoming or outgoing device. After the call is ended, it will switch back to the connected device playing music.\nb) If the device not playing music starts playing music, there will be no sound channel switching. Both devices will remain in the playing state and the device that started playing music later will be in a muted state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does CMF earbuds handle incoming calls when connected to two phones?\t1. When the earbuds are connected to two devices, and neither device is in a call state:\nThe earbuds will output the ringing sound from the device that's receiving a call.\n\n2. When the earbuds are connected to two devices, and one of the devices is already in a call:\nThe earbuds will play the incoming call alert and the earbud buttons will prioritise controlling the device that's receiving a call. If the earbuds hang up the current call, the audio channel will switch to the other device that's receiving a call.\n\nNote: please refer to the product instructions on the official CMF website or get in touch with our Customer Support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I trigger control gestures on CMF earbuds？\tTo ensure proper use of the control gestures on your CMF earbuds, please follow these steps:\n\n1.

Actual battery life may vary depending on volume, frequency, output source, environmental interference, product features used, and usage habits. Actual experience will depend on individual use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Smart ANC Algorithm?\tThe Smart ANC algorithm automatically detects the current wearing status and external noise leakage through the earphones' in-ear detection whenever the earphones are in ANC ON mode. After detection, the earphones will automatically generate corresponding noise reduction parameters to optimize the current noise cancellation effect, providing the best noise cancellation experience for the user. This entire process runs automatically without user intervention.\n\nThe algorithm operates under specific conditions; if the conditions are not met, the algorithm will not be triggered and will default to running with fixed strong noise reduction parameters. This ensures that the basic noise cancellation experience remains unaffected, so you can use it with confidence.\n\nFor the algorithm to function correctly, please ensure the following conditions are met during wear:\n1. The default noise cancellation state after wearing needs to be ANC ON: You can switch to ANC ON state through the app or pressure-sensitive controls after wearing, then remove and re-wear the earphones to trigger the in-ear detection and the Smart ANC algorithm.\n2. To achieve noticeable noise cancellation improvement, ensure the ambient noise level is >65dB when triggering the detection.\n3. Avoid swallowing movements during the detection process.\n\nIf you notice a difference in noise cancellation, you can remove and re-wear the earphones under the above conditions to trigger the algorithm detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan the charging case still charge the earbuds when it is low on battery?\tYes, the charging case can still charge the earbuds when the battery is below 30% but above 1%.

If the earphones are out of range, auto-reconnection will only work for the phone that was out of range. 1.3. Auto-reconnection will not be triggered when the earphones are in an active state (during a call or music playback). 1.4. If the earphones are in the process of auto-reconnection and in an active state (during a call or music playback), the earphones will pause the auto-reconnect for 5 seconds. If the active state is exited within the reconnect timeout, the earphones will resume the paused auto-reconnect until the reconnect timeout is reached (calculated from the first auto-reconnect trigger). 2. Connection priority (connection snatch): When in dual-connectivity mode, the earphones can be snatched by another device and the following applies: 2.1. When neither of the two connected phones is in music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the initially connected phone and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2.2. When the earphones enter pairing mode with a new device, and if they are currently connected to two devices, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices during the pairing process. After one of the devices has been disconnected, it becomes discoverable and can be connected to the new device. 2.3 If the earphones are currently connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a connection snatch, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices. After disconnecting from one device, it can be snatched by the third device initiating the connection snatch. Note: 1. Music playback: 1.1 If one of the two connected phones is in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone not in the music playback state and then connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 1.2 If both phones are in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone that is not producing sound (i.e. the device in a muted music playback state) and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2. Call State: 2.1 If any of the two connected phones is in a call state, connection snatching will not occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the device?

When the charging case is opened, the earphones will automatically power on and reconnect. 1.1 If you have less than two devices connected and the Buds are powered on, they will auto-reconnect in the state of dual connectivity. The reconnect targets the last two connected devices. If it's the first time the earphones are enabling dual connectivity and there are no previous reconnect records, the earphones will stay in single-device connection mode (no pairing occurs and the pairing process for new devices needs to be manually triggered by the user holding down the button). If the earphones fail to reconnect to other devices, they will remain in single-device connection mode (no pairing). 1.2. If the earphones are out of range, auto-reconnection will only work for the phone that was out of range. 1.3. Auto-reconnection will not be triggered when the earphones are in an active state (during a call or music playback). 1.4. If the earphones are in the process of auto-reconnection and in an active state (during a call or music playback), the earphones will pause the auto-reconnect for 5 seconds. If the active state is exited within the reconnect timeout, the earphones will resume the paused auto-reconnect until the reconnect timeout is reached (calculated from the first auto-reconnect trigger). 2. Connection priority (connection snatch): When in dual-connectivity mode, the earphones can be snatched by another device and the following applies: 2.1. When neither of the two connected phones is in music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the initially connected phone and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2.2. When the earphones enter pairing mode with a new device, and if they are currently connected to two devices, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices during the pairing process. After one of the devices has been disconnected, it becomes discoverable and can be connected to the new device. 2.3 If the earphones are currently connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a connection snatch, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices. After disconnecting from one device, it can be snatched by the third device initiating the connection snatch. Note: 1. Music playback: 1.1 If one of the two connected phones is in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone not in the music playback state and then connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 1.2 If both phones are in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone that is not producing sound (i.e. the device in a muted music playback state) and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2. Call State: 2.1 If any of the two connected phones is in a call state, connection snatching will not occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I reset the Neckband Pro?\tAfter separating the left and right earbuds, simultaneously press and hold the Smart Dial and function button for 5 seconds.

Aim for an Active Score of 100 each week to maintain good health.\n\nImportantly, any amount of physical activity is better than none. Incremental increases in physical activity, even at low intensities, can contribute to health improvements by reducing sedentary time.\n\nHow Is It Calculated? \nThe Active Score is tailored to individual profiles, including factors like age, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, and recent exercise history over the last 7 days.\nBy performing physical activities while monitored by your smartwatch, you accumulate Active scores. Activities of higher intensity will generate more scores in less time, enhancing your score more efficiently.\nAs your Active Score grows, acquiring additional points becomes progressively challenging.\n\nWhy Is It Calculated On A 7-Day Basis? \nThe Active Score offers a snapshot of your physical activity impact over a rolling 7-day period. This flexible system allows you to spread your activity throughout the week without the pressure of achieving a high level of exercise every single day. Accumulating scores is possible anytime within this period, although we recommend engaging in physical activities 2-3 times a week to optimize both your physical and mental well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Training Load?\tTraining Load is an estimate of the physical stress exerted on your body during and after a workout, based on parameters such as training time, distance, and intensity. This metric directly relates to your body's fatigue level. \n\nAfter each workout, the Training Load can be calculated using the duration and heart rate of the exercise. By tracking the daily Training Load over seven days, you can observe fluctuations in your weekly Training Load curve.\n\nFollowing a workout, physical fitness initially decreases but gradually increases with proper diet and sleep, often surpassing the original fitness level—a phenomenon known as supercompensation. To improve fitness, it's crucial to balance training and rest; continuous overloading can lead to suboptimal results.\n\nAerobic Training Effect (ATE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Relaxed state (low intensity, helps in relaxation and recovery)\n2.0-2.9: Basic training (maintains basic aerobic fitness)\n3.0-3.9: Effective training (gradually enhances fitness)\n4.0-4.9: Intensive training (promotes significant fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\n\nAnaerobic Training Effect (AnTE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Light activation (awakens muscles with light intensity)\n2.0-2.9: Maintenance level (maintains current muscle status)\n3.0-3.9: Moderate improvement (enhances muscle strength)\n4.0-4.9: Significant enhancement (promotes substantial fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Recovery Time?\tRecovery Time indicates the duration required for you to fully recover your fitness before engaging in the next intense workout.\nThe recovery time is displayed immediately after each exercise session and counts down to help you evaluate when you are ready for high-intensity training again. This feature aids in planning your training schedule effectively. If you work out before fully recovering, the recovery time will accumulate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WorkOut Detection?\t1. On the watch, go to **Settings > Workout detection** and turn on the switch for automatic workout detection.\n2. Once enabled, the device will notify you when it detects that you are exercising.

This is influenced by ear-insertion behaviour during wear. Following the completion of the detection, the earbuds generate noise reduction parameters tailored to optimise the current noise-canceling effect, providing users with the optimum noise-canceling experience. This process runs automatically without user intervention, adapting to usage conditions.\n\n*The algorithm's operation is contingent on certain scenario conditions, and will not be activated if not fulfilled. If not activated, a default strong noise cancellation with fixed parameters will run, which will not affect the fundamental noise cancellation experience, ensuring reliable use.\n**To ensure the algorithm operates correctly, please pay attention to the following conditions during wear:\n1. After wearing the earbuds, the default noise cancellation state should be in ANC ON: You may switch to ANC ON through the app or a pressure-sensitive control after wearing, then take off and re-wear the earbuds to initiate the in-ear detection and activate the Smart ANC algorithm.\n2. For significant noise cancellation improvement, the environmental noise should be greater than 65 dB when detection is triggered by wearing.\n3. Refrain from swallowing actions while wearing the earbuds.\n\nIf you perceive a difference in noise cancellation effectiveness, you can remove the earbuds and put them back in under the above conditions to prompt the algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the earbuds charge properly when the charging case is in low-battery status?\tThe earbuds will charge until the charging case falls below 5% battery. However, when the charging case has nearly depleted, the indicator LED will not display, and the charging case button will be unresponsive. In such cases, please recharge the charging case promptly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Ear (a) support custom EQ settings?\tYes, Ear (a) supports this feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow long do the earbuds take to automatically power off when inactive?\tThe earbuds will automatically power off after 60 minutes of inactivity when not connected and not worn (the duration may vary between different products). To restore functionality, place the earbuds back into the charging case. If the earbuds are fully charged and left unused, they will enter a timeout shutdown mode after 2 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Bluetooth version does Ear (a) use?\tBluetooth 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many equaliser settings does Ear (a) have?\tEar (a) aims to provide a tailored, high-quality listening experience for music enthusiasts.

The device is Nothing Ear, an eraphone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I use the LHDC feature?\tLHDC 5.0 can be understood as the \"highway\" between your phone and earbuds. It supports 24 bit/192 kHz high-resolution audio streaming transmission. The transmission rate can reach up to 1 Mbps, which is about 4 times that of the traditional SBC encoder (328Kbps). The high-resolution audio file will not be over-compressed, so more music details can be retained, and the sound quality will be significantly improved.\n*High-quality audio settings need to be supported by the phone and the selected codec must be enabled on the phone to take effect.\n\nFor Nothing phones, the LHDC Bluetooth audio codec function is turned on by default. After the user connects the headset using Nothing OS, LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission is enabled by default. Users can operate the headset in the Nothing X app to turn on or off LHDC audio encoding.\nFor non-Nothing Android phones, you can check whether the phone supports LHDC in the Bluetooth Audio Codec settings of the phone. If the phone supports it, turn on the phone's LHDC in the settings and confirm that LHDC is checked in the HD encoding options of the Nothing X app. LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission will be turned on.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LHDC high-definition audio, it is recommended to turn off the Dual Connection function when using this function to ensure sufficient bandwidth for the LHDC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth codec, other high-quality audio codecs are not currently supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use the LDAC feature?\tLDAC high-definition audio can be likened to a \"highway\" between the phone and headphones, supporting streaming rates of 990kbps and a sample rate of 96kHz with a bit depth of 24-bit. The high transmission bit rate allows high-resolution audio files to be less compressed, retaining more music details and noticeably improving sound quality.\n*This high-definition audio requires support from the phone and the selected codec needs to be activated on the device to take effect.\n\nFor Android phones, first check if LDAC is enabled by default on your phone. If not, go to [Settings – Developer Options] to see if LDAC is supported. If your phone supports it, activate the phone's LDAC and make sure high-definition encoding is turned on in the Nothing X app, thus enabling LDAC high-definition audio encodinг.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LDAC high-definition audio, it is recommended that when using this feature, 1) the default LDAC playback quality in the developer options is set to adaptive; 2) if the phone chooses a higher quality audio stream, it is advised to turn off dual connection functionality to ensure there is enough bandwidth for the LDAC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth high-quality audio codec, for the time being, they cannot support other high-quality audio codecs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I set up a Personal Sound Profile?\t1.

Check if the phone has crash dump or freeze issue. Press and hold the power button for more than 12 seconds to force the phone to restart.\n4. Uninstall and remove any recently downloaded apps.\n5. Back up your data and restore your phone to factory settings.\n\nIf the issue persists, please contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy phone is unresponsive when charging. What can I do?\tYou can charge your phone by:\n1. Using the charger: please use the Nothing cable and charger to connect the phone to a power outlet for charging.\n2. Using the USB port: connect the phone to the computer or other device via a USB cable.\n\nEnsure you know what the battery and charging icons mean so you can tell the current battery status by the battery icon on the status bar and the lightning bolt icon next to the battery.\nNote: After the battery percentage is turned on, the battery icon will display it (Settings > Battery > Battery percentage).\n\nIf your phone fails to be charged properly when connected, try to:\n1. Disconnect the charging adapter and charging cable again.\n2. Restart and then charge it.\n3. Monitor the temperature of your device. Charging will stop when the temperature is higher than 47°C to protect your device.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy phone is heating up. What can I do?\tPhone use environment\nPhones are generally suitable for use in an environment with a temperature between 0 and 35°C. Temperatures higher or lower than that can affect the operation of the phone, causing overheating and charging issues. In severe cases, they may cause damage to the phone and battery.\n\nAdvice:\n- Don't use your phone for a long time in a high-temperature environment, especially in summer. When the outdoor temperature is high, the phone is prone to heating.\n- When the phone is charging or the temperature rises, take off the case and leave the phone for some time with the screen off. Choose thin and breathable phone cases rather than heavy ones (leather or metal cases).\n- Choose a qualified phone radiator with good heat dissipation and cooling performance, or use a wet tissue to put on the back of the mobile phone to help dissipate heat.\n\nHeating usage scenario:\n1. High-power consumption scenarios\na) The signal is weak\nWhen the WiFi signal and SIM signal are weak, the device will increase the power of transmitting and receiving signals (currently, 5G base station coverage is incomplete, and the network signal is poor in some areas, resulting in increased power consumption and heat generation of mobile phones when using 5G).\nb) Play games\nTo ensure game image quality and smoothness, phone CPU, GPU and other chips need to operate at high performance. The network needs to communicate with the game server in real time. In addition, the screen and speakers work at the same time. The device is running with a high load, and the temperature of the phone will rise accordingly (generally reaches maximum temperature after 20 minutes).\nc) Watch videos\nThe phone screen, data processor and image processor are in a long-term working state. For example, when playing videos or live broadcasts, high-resolution and streaming comments will increase power consumption and generate more heat.\nd) Many backgrounds\nIf there are too many apps running in the background, or if the phone has WiFi, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth and other functions searching for signals or networks in the background, it will easily become overheated.\n\n2. When charging your mobile phone:\nCharging is an energy conversion process. The charging equipment generates a certain amount of heat during operation, causing both the phone and the charger to heat up. This is normal. Phones that support fast charging generate more heat during charging.\n\nSuggestion:\na) Be sure to use the official charger. Don't place the phone in a high-temperature environment with poor heat dissipation when charging.\nb) Avoid playing with your phone while charging. If the phone continues to run during charging, it will increase the load on the phone's CPU and increase heat.\n\nNote:\n- The phone needs hardware to cooperate during operation. When working, it will inevitably generate heat.\n- If the phone heats up inexplicably, turn it off for some time and restart it. If the issue persists, contact our Customer Service or go to the repair center designated by Nothing for testing with your purchase invoice, warranty card and phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battery has dropped quickly. What can I do? Plus, how do I check my phone's power consumption?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. Fast power consumption in a low-temperature environment:\nLithium batteries deteriorate in low-temperature environments, resulting in increased power consumption, which is normal. When the temperature returns to normal, the power consumption normalises, too.\n2. Fast power consumption with 5G network:\nWhen the phone uses the 5G network, the 4G network will be turned on simultaneously, so the power consumption will increase, too. You can turn it on or off as you need. (Path: Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > Preferred network type.\n3. Fast power consumption after a system update:\nDue to system integration and optimisation, power consumption increases after a system update. We recommend restarting the phone after the screen is off and charging it for a whole night after that. It will recover by itself after 2-3 days of normal use.\n4. Check the power consumption details of the phone:\nGo to Settings > Battery > Battery usage on your phone to check the power consumption details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy phone isn't charging. What can I do?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. Check whether the charger is working properly\nConnect the charger to other devices and check whether the charger is charging other devices properly. If not, it means the charger is defective and needs replacing.\nPlease note: Some chargers may have compatibility issues. We recommend using a mainstream charger.\n2. If the charger isn't defective, please:\n1) Replace the cable to check if it can be fixed.\n2) Check whether there is any foreign matter in the charging port of the phone. If so, clean it with a dry brush or other small tools.\n3) Please ensure that the ambient temperature is suitable during the charging process. If the temperature is too high, it will trigger the high-temperature protection and stop charging.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charging speed is slow or my phone won't charge fully. What can I do?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. We recommend using the official Nothing charger and cable.\n2. Replace the charger and cable to check if the adapter or cable is defective.\n3. Avoid using high-power apps when charging, especially games, videos, camera, etc. If your phone is seriously overheated, restart it and wait for the temperature to drop before charging again.\n4. If the ambient temperature is too high or too low, it will affect the phone's charging speed. Charge the phone in a suitable environment of 15℃~35℃.\n5. Restart your phone and re-plug and unplug the cable to try charging.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no sound from the speakers when I play videos.
