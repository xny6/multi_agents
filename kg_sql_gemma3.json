        "KG Result": "## CMF Buds Pro Wireless Charging Capabilities\n\nBased on the provided knowledge base, it appears the CMF Buds 2 support fast charging with a 10-minute charge providing up to 4 hours of playback with ANC off, and an additional 3.5 hours of battery life from the charging case. However, the document does not explicitly state whether CMF Buds Pro 2 support wireless charging, only mentioning that the charging case can be charged. \n\nNotably, the document details the charging case's indicator lights showing charging status and battery level, but it doesn't specify support for wireless charging capabilities. It does mention that the case can still charge the earbuds even when the case battery is low, but this does not imply wireless charging support.\n\n## Battery Life Information\n\nThe CMF Buds 2 offer a playback time of up to 55 hours with the case (with ANC off) and 13.5 hours with just the buds. With ANC on, these times reduce to 32 hours with the case and 7.5 hours with the buds. The CMF Buds Pro 2 offer similar battery life, providing up to 25 hours of playback with the case (with ANC off) and 6 hours with just the buds. \n\n**References:**\n\n*   [DC] unknown_source (Document 1)\n*   [DC] unknown_source (Document 2)\n*   [DC] unknown_source (Document 3)\n*   [DC] unknown_source (Document 4)\n*   [DC] unknown_source (Document 5)",
