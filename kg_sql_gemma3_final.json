You can choose from four distinct ANC modes: **Maximum**, **Light**, **Transparency**, and **Off**. These modes allow you to customize the level of noise cancellation or enable ambient awareness as needed. \n\nTransparency Mode is particularly useful as it allows you to hear surrounding noises as if you weren't wearing the earbuds, enhancing awareness of your surroundings while still enjoying your audio. By turning ANC off, you'll still hear external sounds, but they will be quieter and more subdued compared to having no noise cancellation at all. \n\nYou can adjust these settings within the Nothing X app, allowing for a personalized listening experience tailored to your specific needs.\n\n**References:**\n\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n*   [DC] unknown_source",
