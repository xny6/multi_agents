This allows you to adjust the maximum and minimum brightness levels manually.\n\n3. **Adjust Auto Brightness Sensitivity**:\n   - If there is a specific option for auto brightness sensitivity, modify this setting according to your preference. A higher sensitivity level may result in quicker adjustments based on light changes.\n   - This might not be directly available depending on the version of software you have installed.\n\n4. **Saving Your Settings**:\n   - After making any adjustments, confirm that the settings are saved by either scrolling down and selecting \"Save\" or using a specific button designated for confirming selections.\n\n5. **Troubleshooting Tips**:\n   - If adjusting brightness manually is not working as expected, ensure your Watch Pro's software is updated to the latest version. You can check this under \"Device Upgrade\" in the CMF Watch app.\n   - Verify that you have properly connected your phone with Bluetooth and set up the Watch Pro via the CMF Watch app to sync settings correctly.\n\n#### Additional Tips for Optimal Use\n- **Regularly Charge Your Device**: A full charge ensures that your watch can operate its features optimally without being overly concerned about battery life, especially when using manual adjustments.\n- **Manage Notifications**: Too many notifications could drain the battery faster, affecting both screen brightness functionality and overall usage.\n\n### References:\n1.

        "KG Result": "### Compatibility with Fast Charging:\n\nThe Nothing Phone series is designed to support fast charging. To achieve full charge within approximately one hour, users should utilize a PPS (Power Delivery Profile Specification) protocol charger—ideally the official Nothing Charger for optimal performance and safety. The charger's compatibility with a PPS protocol ensures that it can provide faster charging speeds compared to standard chargers.\n\nIn terms of managing energy consumption when using 5G networks:\n\n1. **Increased Fast Power Consumption:** When using both 4G and 5G networks simultaneously, there is an increase in fast power consumption due to the simultaneous operation of these networks. This is because modern smartphones need more power to handle multiple network connections.\n\n2. **Balancing Network Usage and Battery Life:** The device's management system optimizes power usage by prioritizing performance when needed (e.g., during 5G connectivity for streaming or high-bandwidth tasks) while attempting to conserve battery life in other situations, like when waiting or browsing web content that doesn't require intensive data usage.\n\n3. **Automatic Network Switching:** The phone might switch between networks based on availability and signal strength, which can influence the amount of power consumed by network connectivity. For instance, when a stronger WiFi signal is available, switching to WiFi reduces energy consumption compared to keeping 5G active continuously.\n\n4. **User Settings for Power Management:** Users have control over certain settings that manage how their device handles different types of network connections. They can adjust preferences related to the use of mobile data or WiFi networks through system settings to optimize power usage and battery life.\n\n### References:\n\n- [KG] unknown_source\n- [KG] unknown_source",

        "KG Result": "### Dual Connection Feature Overview for CMF Buds 2 Pro\n\nThe CMF Buds 2 Pro offers a unique Dual Connection capability that allows users like Kim Osborne to connect their headphones with two devices simultaneously without interfering with the audio quality or connectivity between them.\n\n#### Steps to Utilize Dual Connection:\n\n1. **Enable Pairing Mode**: Start by ensuring both of your connected devices are in pairing mode. Typically, this involves accessing Bluetooth settings on each device and putting it into \"discoverable\" or \"pairing\" mode.\n\n2. **Pair with CMF Buds 2 Pro**:\n   - Open the packaging and remove one earbud.\n   - Remove the battery cover (if applicable) to access the pairing button or sensor, usually located at the bottom of each earbud.\n   - Hold down the pairing button until the LED indicator starts flashing. The specific procedure varies depending on the model of CMF Buds 2 Pro, but typically involves pressing and holding for around 5 seconds.\n\n3. **Initiate Dual Connection**: \n   - Once your first device (Device A) is paired with an earbud successfully, you can initiate dual connection by pairing Device B to the other earbud.\n   - While the first earbud remains connected to Device A, repeat the pairing process for the second earbud with Device B.\n\n4. **Manage Connections**: \n   - After both earbuds are successfully paired, they will be able to connect with two devices simultaneously. This allows for seamless audio switching between Device A and Device B without having to disconnect from one device.\n   - To manage which device is outputting audio at any given time, users typically need to switch manually on the CMF Buds 2 Pro or through settings on their connected devices.\n\n5. **Utilize Features**:\n   - Dual Connection allows for enhanced functionality including sharing audio between two devices during video calls, providing a more versatile listening experience.\n   - Users can customize this feature further with software updates if available through an application like the Nothing X app.\n\n6. **Troubleshooting and Maintenance**: \n   - Occasionally there might be issues with connectivity or sound quality when using Dual Connection. This could be due to interference from other wireless devices, power supply, or specific settings on either device.\n   - If experiencing problems, users can refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by CMF Watch company or seek assistance through their support channels.\n\n#### Benefits of Dual Connection:\n- **Increased Flexibility**: Allows for simultaneous use across two devices without losing connectivity with any one of them.\n- **Versatile Use Cases**: Suitable for scenarios like watching videos on a tablet while using a phone for calls, or connecting to both office and home speakers simultaneously.\n- **Efficient Multi-tasking**: Ideal for individuals who frequently switch between multiple audio sources without needing to physically disconnect and reconnect devices.\n\n### References:\n1.
