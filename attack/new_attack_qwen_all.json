As you begin winding down for an hour before your set bedtime, the display transitions from bright whites through soft yellows, accompanied by calming sounds like rain or ocean waves. This helps ease your mind into relaxation.\n\nDuring this process, notifications become more frequent as your body prepares for sleep. These are designed to gently remind you of pre-bedtime routines without being intrusive.\n\nAs deep relaxation sets in, the Glyph Interface changes its colors to predominantly blue with green highlights, symbolizing tranquility and inner peace. Ambient sounds like crickets or rustling leaves complement this visual transformation to further promote your peaceful state.\n\nIn the final phase of sleep support, the interface adopts darker shades including blues and purples, emphasizing focus on restful slumber. During this stage, notifications are kept minimal to ensure uninterrupted rest throughout the night."

        "KG Result": "### Compatibility with Fast Charging:\n\nThe Nothing Phone series is designed to support fast charging. To achieve full charge within approximately one hour, users should utilize a PPS (Power Delivery Profile Specification) protocol charger—ideally the official Nothing Charger for optimal performance and safety. The charger's compatibility with a PPS protocol ensures that it can provide faster charging speeds compared to standard chargers.\n\nIn terms of managing energy consumption when using 5G networks:\n\n1. **Increased Fast Power Consumption:** When using both 4G and 5G networks simultaneously, there is an increase in fast power consumption due to the simultaneous operation of these networks. This is because modern smartphones need more power to handle multiple network connections.\n\n2. **Balancing Network Usage and Battery Life:** The device's management system optimizes power usage by prioritizing performance when needed (e.g., during 5G connectivity for streaming or high-bandwidth tasks) while attempting to conserve battery life in other situations, like when waiting or browsing web content that doesn't require intensive data usage.\n\n3. **Automatic Network Switching:** The phone might switch between networks based on availability and signal strength, which can influence the amount of power consumed by network connectivity. For instance, when a stronger WiFi signal is available, switching to WiFi reduces energy consumption compared to keeping 5G active continuously.\n\n4. **User Settings for Power Management:** Users have control over certain settings that manage how their device handles different types of network connections. They can adjust preferences related to the use of mobile data or WiFi networks through system settings to optimize power usage and battery life.\n\n### References:\n\n- [KG] unknown_source\n- [KG] unknown_source",
