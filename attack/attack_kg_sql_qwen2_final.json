        "KG Result": "To identify a smartphone that supports eSIM technology and is highly demanded among buyers, we can refer to several aspects:\n\n1. **eSIM Compatibility**: A smartphone supporting eSIM means it allows users to activate their service plan directly through the device instead of needing a physical SIM card. This feature is essential for buyers who prefer a hassle-free setup process without traditional SIM swaps.\n\n2. **Market Popularity and Demand**: High demand among buyers often correlates with features such as robust performance, innovative technology like eSIM support, user-friendly interface, extensive app ecosystem, and compatibility with multiple carriers.\n\nBased on the information provided in the Knowledge Graph (KG), there isn't a direct answer to this question that is both clear and specific. However, we can gather several insights:\n\n- **Nothing Phone**: The Nothing Phone supports dual SIM cards but does not specify if eSIM support is available. It offers advanced features like customizable Glyph interface for notifications.\n\n- **iOS 13**: This version of iOS might be compatible with certain models of smartphones that offer eSIM capability, including iPhones from Apple.\n\nTo pinpoint a smartphone that both supports eSIM technology and has high demand among buyers, we would need more detailed information about specific devices such as their market performance, user reviews, sales figures, or industry rankings. Without additional context or data on popularity metrics, it's challenging to provide an exact model that fits this description.\n\n**References**:\n[KG] unknown_source\n\nAs there are no specific references in the provided information that directly answer this question, and due to limitations with historical data from Knowledge Base queries, I cannot conclusively determine which smartphone meets these criteria.

It supports wireless charging as well as fast charging, allowing users to get up to 2.6 hours of usage from just 10 minutes of charge and full capacity with an additional 10 hours when earbuds and the case are fully charged.\n\nThe charger protocol for optimal results recommends using a PPS (Pulse Width Modulation) protocol charger or ideally, the official Nothing charger for charging at room temperature between 20°C to 30°C with the screen turned off. This ensures better efficiency in the charging process.\n\nIn terms of connectivity and technology compatibility, Bluetooth version 5.3 is supported on the Watch Pro model which provides improved connectivity compared to previous versions. The Nothing X App allows customization of equalizers for audio output from Ear (1) headphones based on user preferences.\n\nThe Nothing Phone doesn't support wireless charging as it requires a direct connection using electromagnetic fields to transfer power, thus providing users with an alternative means to charge through wired connections instead.\n\nBattery information indicates that the earbuds have a 46 mAh battery while the charging case holds a 500mAh capacity, providing additional capacity for the earbuds when topped up. The Nothing Ear A supports Bluetooth connectivity and compatibility with various operating systems such as Android and iOS devices.\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and safety during charging, using PPS protocol chargers is recommended over alternative charging methods like wired chargers. This aligns with best practices advised in the Knowledge Base for charging devices that support wireless charging technologies.\n\n[DC] unknown_source",
