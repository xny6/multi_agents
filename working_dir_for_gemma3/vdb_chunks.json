Open the Nothing X app and follow the steps to connect to Ear (2) again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if Ear (a) doesn't automatically connect/reconnect to my device?\t1. When connected to multiple devices, the earbuds will prioritise reconnecting with the last device connected upon powering on again. Please confirm if the last device used is the one you are currently using.\n2. If the earbuds leave the charging case and don't find the last connected device within 1 minute, they will enter a timeout state. To exit it, place the earbuds back into the case, close the lid for 5 seconds and then reopen to initiate a new connection.\n3. Perform a factory reset by holding the function button on the charging case for 10 seconds or more, and then pair the earbuds again.\n4. If the issue remains unresolved, please download and update to the latest software using the Nothing X App.\n\nNote: All device customisations are already integrated into the settings of Nothing OS version 1.1.4 and higher. Please keep the Nothing X app updated via the Google Play Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if my earphone does not reconnect to a device within the Bluetooth range?\t1. The earbuds will automatically disconnect when the Bluetooth connection exceeds the range. If you return to the connection range within 10 minutes, they will automatically reconnect successfully. If they stay outside of the connection range for more than 10 minutes, they will enter a timeout state without a connection. You can manually reconnect by placing the earbuds into the charging case, closing the charging case for 5 seconds, and then opening the charging case to power on the earbuds and initiate the connection again. 2. Long-press the function button on the charging case for 5 seconds and reset to factory settings - complete when the indicator light flashes red for 10 seconds. Then re-pair for use. 3. If the issue remains unresolved, please download and upgrade to the latest version of the Nothing X App and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I see earphone in my phone's Bluetooth list?\t1. Since Bluetooth device searching is an interactive process between a phone and a pair of earbuds, the phone side may have Bluetooth logic issues that hinder the search for earphones. This phenomenon is not an issue with the earbuds. You can try turning the phone's Bluetooth off and then on again, or restart the device and try searching again. 2. If the problem persists, place both earbuds in the charging case, close the lid, and wait for more than 30 seconds to allow the earbuds to reboot, or place them in the case and open the lid, then long-press the function key for more than 10 seconds to restore to factory settings before trying again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do if PIN code error is displayed while pairing my Watch Pro with my phone?\t1.

Reconnection on lid open:\na) If the earbuds are connected to fewer than two devices, with dual connection enabled and the earbuds are powered on, they will attempt to reconnect to the last two connected devices. If dual connection is enabled for the first time with no previous reconnection records, the earbuds will maintain a single-device connection. (In single connection mode, the earbuds will not automatically enter pairing mode; pairing a new device requires a manual long-press of the button.) If reconnection to other devices fails, the earbuds will stay connected to a single device and will not enter pairing mode.\n\nb) If the earbuds and the terminal device exceed the connection range and then return within range, the earbuds will only reconnect to the phone that was disconnected due to distance.\n\nc) Reconnection will not be triggered when the earbuds are in a call or music state.\n\nd) If the earbuds are in a reconnection state and a call or music scenario occurs, the earbuds will pause reconnection for 5 seconds. If the call or music ends within the reconnection timeout period, the earbuds will resume the paused reconnection until the timeout. After the reconnection timeout, the connection can only be initiated from the device end.\n\n2. Connection priority:\nWhen the earbuds are in dual connection mode, connection priority follows these principles:\na) If neither of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the first connected phone and connect to the device initiating the snatch.\nb) When the earbuds enter pairing mode and are already connected to two devices, they will disconnect from one of the devices to be searchable and connectable.\nc) If the earbuds are already connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a snatch, the earbuds will disconnect from one of the devices and connect to the third device.\n\nTips:\n\nMusic state:\n1. If one of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone that is not in the music state and connect to the device initiating the snatch.\n2. If both phones are in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone whose music is not outputting through the earbuds (i.e., disconnect the device in the muted music state) and connect to the device initiating the snatch.\n\nCall state:\n1.", "full_doc_id": "doc-8e956e338cafa11281135d777c67ec77", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-a00c7749dfd2673450923248396c0aac", "__created_at__": 1759822560, "content": "device.\n\nTips:\n\nMusic state:\n1.

Actual experience will depend on individual use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Smart ANC Algorithm?\tThe Smart ANC algorithm automatically detects the current wearing status and external noise leakage through the earphones' in-ear detection whenever the earphones are in ANC ON mode. After detection, the earphones will automatically generate corresponding noise reduction parameters to optimize the current noise cancellation effect, providing the best noise cancellation experience for the user. This entire process runs automatically without user intervention.\n\nThe algorithm operates under specific conditions; if the conditions are not met, the algorithm will not be triggered and will default to running with fixed strong noise reduction parameters. This ensures that the basic noise cancellation experience remains unaffected, so you can use it with confidence.\n\nFor the algorithm to function correctly, please ensure the following conditions are met during wear:\n1. The default noise cancellation state after wearing needs to be ANC ON: You can switch to ANC ON state through the app or pressure-sensitive controls after wearing, then remove and re-wear the earphones to trigger the in-ear detection and the Smart ANC algorithm.\n2. To achieve noticeable noise cancellation improvement, ensure the ambient noise level is >65dB when triggering the detection.\n3. Avoid swallowing movements during the detection process.\n\nIf you notice a difference in noise cancellation, you can remove and re-wear the earphones under the above conditions to trigger the algorithm detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan the charging case still charge the earbuds when it is low on battery?\tYes, the charging case can still charge the earbuds when the battery is below 30% but above 1%.

Auto-reconnection will not be triggered when the earphones are in an active state (during a call or music playback). 1.4. If the earphones are in the process of auto-reconnection and in an active state (during a call or music playback), the earphones will pause the auto-reconnect for 5 seconds. If the active state is exited within the reconnect timeout, the earphones will resume the paused auto-reconnect until the reconnect timeout is reached (calculated from the first auto-reconnect trigger). 2. Connection priority (connection snatch): When in dual-connectivity mode, the earphones can be snatched by another device and the following applies: 2.1. When neither of the two connected phones is in music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the initially connected phone and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2.2. When the earphones enter pairing mode with a new device, and if they are currently connected to two devices, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices during the pairing process. After one of the devices has been disconnected, it becomes discoverable and can be connected to the new device. 2.3 If the earphones are currently connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a connection snatch, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices. After disconnecting from one device, it can be snatched by the third device initiating the connection snatch. Note: 1. Music playback: 1.1 If one of the two connected phones is in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone not in the music playback state and then connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 1.2 If both phones are in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone that is not producing sound (i.e. the device in a muted music playback state) and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2.

Activities of higher intensity will generate more scores in less time, enhancing your score more efficiently.\nAs your Active Score grows, acquiring additional points becomes progressively challenging.\n\nWhy Is It Calculated On A 7-Day Basis? \nThe Active Score offers a snapshot of your physical activity impact over a rolling 7-day period.

Accumulating scores is possible anytime within this period, although we recommend engaging in physical activities 2-3 times a week to optimize both your physical and mental well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Training Load?\tTraining Load is an estimate of the physical stress exerted on your body during and after a workout, based on parameters such as training time, distance, and intensity. This metric directly relates to your body's fatigue level. \n\nAfter each workout, the Training Load can be calculated using the duration and heart rate of the exercise. By tracking the daily Training Load over seven days, you can observe fluctuations in your weekly Training Load curve.\n\nFollowing a workout, physical fitness initially decreases but gradually increases with proper diet and sleep, often surpassing the original fitness level—a phenomenon known as supercompensation. To improve fitness, it's crucial to balance training and rest; continuous overloading can lead to suboptimal results.\n\nAerobic Training Effect (ATE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Relaxed state (low intensity, helps in relaxation and recovery)\n2.0-2.9: Basic training (maintains basic aerobic fitness)\n3.0-3.9: Effective training (gradually enhances fitness)\n4.0-4.9: Intensive training (promotes significant fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\n\nAnaerobic Training Effect (AnTE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Light activation (awakens muscles with light intensity)\n2.0-2.9: Maintenance level (maintains current muscle status)\n3.0-3.9: Moderate improvement (enhances muscle strength)\n4.0-4.9: Significant enhancement (promotes substantial fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Recovery Time?\tRecovery Time indicates the duration required for you to fully recover your fitness before engaging in the next intense workout.\nThe recovery time is displayed immediately after each exercise session and counts down to help you evaluate when you are ready for high-intensity training again. This feature aids in planning your training schedule effectively. If you work out before fully recovering, the recovery time will accumulate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WorkOut Detection?\t1. On the watch, go to **Settings > Workout detection** and turn on the switch for automatic workout detection.\n2. Once enabled, the device will notify you when it detects that you are exercising.

The device is Nothing Ear, an eraphone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I use the LHDC feature?\tLHDC 5.0 can be understood as the \"highway\" between your phone and earbuds. It supports 24 bit/192 kHz high-resolution audio streaming transmission. The transmission rate can reach up to 1 Mbps, which is about 4 times that of the traditional SBC encoder (328Kbps). The high-resolution audio file will not be over-compressed, so more music details can be retained, and the sound quality will be significantly improved.\n*High-quality audio settings need to be supported by the phone and the selected codec must be enabled on the phone to take effect.\n\nFor Nothing phones, the LHDC Bluetooth audio codec function is turned on by default. After the user connects the headset using Nothing OS, LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission is enabled by default. Users can operate the headset in the Nothing X app to turn on or off LHDC audio encoding.\nFor non-Nothing Android phones, you can check whether the phone supports LHDC in the Bluetooth Audio Codec settings of the phone. If the phone supports it, turn on the phone's LHDC in the settings and confirm that LHDC is checked in the HD encoding options of the Nothing X app. LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission will be turned on.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LHDC high-definition audio, it is recommended to turn off the Dual Connection function when using this function to ensure sufficient bandwidth for the LHDC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth codec, other high-quality audio codecs are not currently supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use the LDAC feature?\tLDAC high-definition audio can be likened to a \"highway\" between the phone and headphones, supporting streaming rates of 990kbps and a sample rate of 96kHz with a bit depth of 24-bit. The high transmission bit rate allows high-resolution audio files to be less compressed, retaining more music details and noticeably improving sound quality.\n*This high-definition audio requires support from the phone and the selected codec needs to be activated on the device to take effect.\n\nFor Android phones, first check if LDAC is enabled by default on your phone. If not, go to [Settings – Developer Options] to see if LDAC is supported. If your phone supports it, activate the phone's LDAC and make sure high-definition encoding is turned on in the Nothing X app, thus enabling LDAC high-definition audio encodinг.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LDAC high-definition audio, it is recommended that when using this feature, 1) the default LDAC playback quality in the developer options is set to adaptive; 2) if the phone chooses a higher quality audio stream, it is", "full_doc_id": "doc-8e956e338cafa11281135d777c67ec77", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d2a9c4419d0d3ab7a355fe65d33c609f", "__created_at__": 1759822560, "content": "to see if LDAC is supported.

Disconnect the charging adapter and charging cable again.\n2. Restart and then charge it.\n3. Monitor the temperature of your device. Charging will stop when the temperature is higher than 47°C to protect your device.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy phone is heating up. What can I do?\tPhone use environment\nPhones are generally suitable for use in an environment with a temperature between 0 and 35°C. Temperatures higher or lower than that can affect the operation of the phone, causing overheating and charging issues. In severe cases, they may cause damage to the phone and battery.\n\nAdvice:\n- Don't use your phone for a long time in a high-temperature environment, especially in summer. When the outdoor temperature is high, the phone is prone to heating.\n- When the phone is charging or the temperature rises, take off the case and leave the phone for some time with the screen off. Choose thin and breathable phone cases rather than heavy ones (leather or metal cases).\n- Choose a qualified phone radiator with good heat dissipation and cooling performance, or use a wet tissue to put on the back of the mobile phone to help dissipate heat.\n\nHeating usage scenario:\n1. High-power consumption scenarios\na) The signal is weak\nWhen the WiFi signal and SIM signal are weak, the device will increase the power of transmitting and receiving signals (currently, 5G base station coverage is incomplete, and the network signal is poor in some areas, resulting in increased power consumption and heat generation of mobile phones when using 5G).\nb) Play games\nTo ensure game image quality and smoothness, phone CPU, GPU and other chips need to operate at high performance. The network needs to communicate with the game server in real time. In addition, the screen and speakers work at the same time. The device is running with a high load, and the temperature of the phone will rise accordingly (generally reaches maximum temperature after 20 minutes).\nc) Watch videos\nThe phone screen, data processor and image processor are in a long-term working state. For example, when playing videos or live broadcasts, high-resolution and streaming comments will increase power consumption and generate more heat.\nd) Many backgrounds\nIf there are too many apps running in the background, or if the phone has WiFi, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth and other functions searching for signals or networks in the background, it will easily become overheated.\n\n2. When charging your mobile phone:\nCharging is an energy conversion process. The charging equipment generates a certain amount of heat during operation, causing both the phone and the charger to heat up. This is normal. Phones that support fast charging generate more heat during charging.\n\nSuggestion:\na) Be sure to use the official charger. Don't place the phone in a high-temperature environment with poor heat dissipation when charging.\nb) Avoid playing with your phone while charging. If the phone continues to run during charging, it will increase the load on the phone's CPU and increase heat.\n\nNote:\n- The phone needs hardware to cooperate during operation. When working, it will inevitably generate heat.\n- If the phone heats up inexplicably, turn it off for some time and restart it. If the issue persists, contact our Customer Service or go to the repair center designated by Nothing for testing with your purchase invoice, warranty card and phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battery has dropped quickly. What can I do? Plus, how do I check my phone's power consumption?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. Fast power consumption in a low-temperature environment:\nLithium batteries deteriorate in low-temperature environments, resulting in increased power consumption, which is normal. When the temperature returns to normal, the power consumption normalises, too.\n2. Fast power consumption with 5G network:\nWhen the phone uses the 5G network, the 4G network will be turned on simultaneously, so the power consumption will increase, too. You can turn it on or off as you need. (Path: Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > Preferred network type.\n3.

Check the power consumption details of the phone:\nGo to Settings > Battery > Battery usage on your phone to check the power consumption details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy phone isn't charging. What can I do?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. Check whether the charger is working properly\nConnect the charger to other devices and check whether the charger is charging other devices properly. If not, it means the charger is defective and needs replacing.\nPlease note: Some chargers may have compatibility issues. We recommend using a mainstream charger.\n2. If the charger isn't defective, please:\n1) Replace the cable to check if it can be fixed.\n2) Check whether there is any foreign matter in the charging port of the phone. If so, clean it with a dry brush or other small tools.\n3) Please ensure that the ambient temperature is suitable during the charging process. If the temperature is too high, it will trigger the high-temperature protection and stop charging.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charging speed is slow or my phone won't charge fully. What can I do?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. We recommend using the official Nothing charger and cable.\n2. Replace the charger and cable to check if the adapter or cable is defective.\n3. Avoid using high-power apps when charging, especially games, videos, camera, etc. If your phone is seriously overheated, restart it and wait for the temperature to drop before charging again.\n4. If the ambient temperature is too high or too low, it will affect the phone's charging speed. Charge the phone in a suitable environment of 15℃~35℃.\n5. Restart your phone and re-plug and unplug the cable to try charging.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no sound from the speakers when I play videos.
