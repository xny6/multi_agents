It focuses specifically on call-related audio rather than music playback.\n\n#### Functionality in Nothing Ear:\n- **Purpose**: The primary goal of ENC is to suppress external noise when using the microphone during calls.\n- **Implementation**: \n  - ENC is activated automatically during calls, filtering out background noise to enhance voice clarity.\n  - It works alongside other features like ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) but serves a different purpose: while ANC enhances audio playback by reducing ambient noise, ENC focuses on improving call quality.\n\n#### Functionality in Nothing Ear Open:\n- **ENC Limitation**: The Nothing Ear Open model does not support ENC. This means it cannot actively suppress background noise during calls, potentially leading to reduced call clarity compared to other models like the Nothing Ear (a) or Ear Stick.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Distinct Features**:\n   - **ANC**: Focuses on audio playback by reducing ambient noise for better listening experiences.\n   - **ENC**: Focuses on calls by suppressing background noise during voice communication.\n\n2. **Availability**:\n   - **Nothing Ear (a) and Ear Stick**: Support ENC, enhancing call quality.\n   - **Ear (open)**: Does not support ENC, making it less suitable for noisy environments when using the microphone.\n\n### References:\n1.
